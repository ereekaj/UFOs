# UFOs

## Overview of Project:

I've been working with Dana to create a website that displays data about UFO sightings. The purporse of this particular project is to use Javascript to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time and view the data they would like to see.  

## Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

The website is a simple website with a picture heading, a subheading and article about UFOs, a table with data on UFO sightings and a form allowing the user to enter in text criteria to filter the ufo sighting data.  The picture below is of the home page.  

The table of data is updated based on what text is entered into the form. The filter options are for Date, City, State, Country and Shape. The piture below shows the filter form.  

To use the filters, a user must enter text corresponding to the type of field into the text box. There is placeholder text in each text field guiding the user on what text should be entered. Once the text is entered, the user must hit "Enter" on their keyboard and the table will update with the data filtered by the text entered by the user.  The table is black if no data corresponds to the requested filters.  The user can re-enter text into the form filters to request new data based on new filters.  

## Summary: 

In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
